# Pyscript

#### A JavaScript library that includes functions that act as close as possible to the Python counterparts

## Usage

### Downloading the code:

Import everything as a name you picked (preferably `Pyscript`)

```js
import * as Pyscript from "./path/to/pyscript";

console.log(Pyscript);
```

or import specific functions

```js
import { range } from "./path/to/pyscript";

console.log(range(10, 20, 2));
```

### Using the package:

#### Install using npm:

```
npm install pyscript
```

#### Install using yarn:

```
yarn add pyscript
```

#### Usage:

I have no idea why it's like this. I'm a noob.

```js
import { Pyscript } from "pyscript";

console.log(Pyscript);
```
